## Project Description
This project aims to create an accessible and user-friendly application that integrates NFC technology, speech recognition, and chatbot capabilities to assist visually impaired individuals. This application provides an accessible solution for visually impaired individuals to independently access detailed information about products, hence enhancing their autonomy and independence in daily activities. As someone who heavily relies on glasses, I understand the importance of accessibility and the value of having reliable tools to aid in daily tasks.

This project leverages NFC technology to provide a seamless and accessible way for users to retrieve product information by scanning NFC tags attached to price tags with their mobile devices.

### Key Features
- NFC-Based Scanning: Users can quickly access detailed product information by scanning NFC tags with their smartphones, eliminating the need for manual search or input.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) Support: Converts written product details into audible speech, enhancing accessibility for visually impaired users.
- Speech-to-Text (STT) Integration: Currently utilizes the device's native STT capabilities to allow users to ask questions and issue commands verbally.
- AI-Powered Chatbot: Integrates with the ChatGPT API to handle complex queries and enable nuanced, conversational interactions. Responses are audibly delivered through the TTS engine.

### Future Enhancements
- Expansion of native Speech-to-Text (STT) support within the app to improve voice command accuracy and flexibility.
- Continuous improvement of the ChatGPT-powered chatbot for more natural and human-like conversations.
