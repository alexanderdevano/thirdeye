# Third Eye

## Goal
This project aims to create an accessible and user-friendly application that integrates NFC technology, speech recognition, and chatbot capabilities to assist visually impaired individuals. This application provides an accessible solution for visually impaired individuals to independently access detailed information about products, hence enhancing their autonomy and independence in daily activities. As someone who heavily relies on glasses, I understand the importance of accessibility and the value of having reliable tools to aid in daily tasks.
